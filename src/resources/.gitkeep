# Resources directory

This directory is for additional resources that don't fit into other categories.

Examples:
- Data files: .json, .xml, .csv
- Documentation: .md, .txt
- Configuration: .conf, .ini
- Templates: .hbs, .ejs
- Other static files

Files placed here will be copied to the build directory but may not
undergo the same processing as assets (no minification/hashing).
